This talk discusses the violation of Hundâ€™s rule in molecules like cyclazine due to inverted singlet-triplet gaps, and its implications for designing efficient OLED materials using thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). It highlights computational approaches to accurately predict excited-state properties for next-generation emitter screening.
