<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to My Space of Quantum-Astro-Chemie</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Nexus of Theoretical Chemistry and Astrchemistry</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I am a master's student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata, exploring the fascinating intersection between theoretical chemistry and astrochemistry. My research focuses on understanding the complex chemical processes occurring in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), driven by molecular interactions and bombardment of energetic, charged particles (< 1 GeV) dubbed Cosmic-Rays (CRs), triggering a diverse zoo of chemical species interconnected by dynamical pathways.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Areas of Research</h1>

<!-- Gas-Grain Astrochemistry Section -->
<div class="research-section">
  <div>
    <h2>Gas-Grain Astrochemistry</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This work explores the interactions between gas-phase molecules and solid grains in molecular clouds, particularly in dense regions. It focuses on the kinetics of surface-mediated reactions, essential for understanding the formation of complex organic species and the origins of life in the universe.</p>

<!-- Quantum Reaction Dynamics Section -->
<div class="research-section">
  <div>
    <h2>Quantum Reaction Dynamics</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The research in quantum dynamics examines reaction mechanisms by generating potential energy surfaces and conducting simulations. This work aims to determine reaction rates for incorporation into astrochemical models, enhancing our understanding of molecular interactions in astrophysical environments.</p>

<!-- Cosmic Ray Astrochemistry Section -->
<div class="research-section">
  <div>
    <h2>Cosmic Ray Astrochemistry</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The cosmic ray astrochemistry explores cosmic rays' effects on molecular clouds, particularly in proton-dominated regions (PDRs). I aim to understand how high-energy particles influence molecular formation and use radiative transfer modeling to assess their impact on high rovibrational lines of molecules, shedding light on cloud chemistry in low-density star-forming regions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Research Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> My research work encompasses three interrelated areas: gas-grain astrochemistry, where I investigate ice surface adsorption-desorption and the  dynamic studies of gas-phase key reactions that unravel the complexities of interstellar chemistry; and cosmic ray astrochemistry, focusing on how high-energy cosmic rays influence molecular gases and drive chemical processes in interstellar environments. Together, these aspects aim to enhance our understanding of the fundamental processes that govern the formation and evolution of complex species in the molecular universe.
