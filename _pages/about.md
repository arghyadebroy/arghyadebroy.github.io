<h1>Welcome to My Space of Quantum-Astro-Chemie</h1>
<h2>The Nexus of Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Astrophysics</h2>

<p>
    I am a master's student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata, exploring the fascinating intersection between quantum chemistry and molecular astrophysics. My research focuses on understanding the complex chemical processes occurring in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), driven by molecular interactions and bombardment of energetic, charged particles (< 1 GeV) dubbed Cosmic-Rays (CRs), triggering a diverse zoo of chemical species interconnected by dynamical pathways.

<h1>Areas of Research</h1>

<div class="research-section">
  <div>
    <h2>Gas-Grain Astrochemistry</h2>
    <p>This research explores the interactions between gas-phase molecules and solid grains in molecular clouds, particularly in dense regions. It focuses on the kinetics of surface-mediated reactions, essential for understanding the formation of complex organic species and the origins of life in the universe.</p>

    <h2>Cosmic Ray Astrochemistry</h2>
    <p>The cosmic ray astrochemistry research explores cosmic rays' effects on molecular clouds, particularly in proton-dominated regions (PDRs). I aim to understand how high-energy particles influence molecular formation and use radiative transfer modeling to assess their impact on high ro-vibrational lines of molecules, shedding light on cloud chemistry in low-density star-forming regions.</p>

## Research Overview
<p>
My research work encompasses three interrelated areas: gas-grain astrochemistry, where I investigate ice surface adsorption-desorption; the dynamics studies of gas-phase reactions that unravel the complexities of interstellar chemistry; and cosmic ray astrochemistry, focusing on how high-energy cosmic rays influence molecular gases and drive chemical processes in interstellar environments. Together, these aspects aim to enhance our understanding of the fundamental processes that govern the formation and evolution of complex species in the molecular universe.
