title: "Certificate of Participation"
excerpt: "Conferred for participation in the online webinar on *Dust, Ice, and Grain Astrochemistry*. This engaging session provided a comprehensive examination of the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, as well as the pathways leading to the synthesis of simple to complex organic species, including Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Participants explored the intricate chemical processes involved in grain interactions and their implications for the development of organic chemistry in astrophysical environments, enhancing their understanding of astrochemical dynamics. <br/><img src='/images/Arghyadeb Roy-1_page-0001.jpg'>"
