excerpt: 'Here, we employed a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of seven diatomic radicals – CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO – that play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which helps explain the recently observed HONO/NH2OH and HONO/HNO ratios in the low-mass hot corino IRAS 16293–2422 B with chemical models.'
