This course offers a comprehensive overview of the states of matter, focusing on gaseous and liquid phases through concepts such as gas laws, molecular velocity distributions, and intermolecular forces. It explores thermodynamics by introducing systems, state functions, and the First and Second Laws, covering energy conservation, entropy, and free energy in reversible and irreversible processes. Additionally, the course delves into chemical kinetics, addressing reaction rates, order, the Arrhenius equation, and enzyme kinetics, while incorporating advanced topics like the steady-state approximation and transition state theory to elucidate molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms.
