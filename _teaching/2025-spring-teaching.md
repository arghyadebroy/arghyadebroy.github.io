This course introduces the mathematical framework of group theory and molecular symmetry, highlighting their fundamental role in understanding the structure, bonding, and spectroscopy of chemical systems. It explores how symmetry operations and point groups can simplify complex molecular problems, predict spectroscopic transitions, and explain degeneracies in molecular orbitals, thereby bridging abstract mathematical concepts with practical chemical applications.
